In one day I traveled 205.2 miles that resulted in a woman with lupus being rehoused from a black mold infested house, a young girl with a heart defect and her young daughter keeping their housing, rehoused a young mother of 4 including a newborn, and lastly assisting a severely mentally ill young lady into her own apartment after what I believe to be a wrongful eviction from public housing.
